# Web in Movement
Rails Project for data analysis about the Chilean student movement organizations and protests between 2011-2013.

I made ruby scripts to implement a database with raw data of tweets and mentions of certain actors involved in the protests.

Also, some views for charts and to easily download processed data.

All this work is made for Marisa Von Bülow and Cristóbal García (PUC-Chile).
